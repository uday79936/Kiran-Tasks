# 🚀 Steps to Start an EC2 Instance, Install Java 11, and Deploy a Java Application

This guide outlines the steps performed on an AWS EC2 instance to install Java 11, clone a Git repository, build a Maven project, install and configure Tomcat, and deploy a WAR file.

---

## 1. Connect to EC2 Instance via SSH

> *(Steps to navigate the AWS console to the EC2 dashboard are assumed to be done through the web interface.)*

- Open your local terminal.
- Navigate to the directory containing your SSH private key file:

```bash
cd Downloads/
Establish an SSH connection to your EC2 instance using the provided key and public DNS:

'''
ssh -i "Test.pem" ubuntu@ec2-98-81-227-245.compute-1.amazonaws.com
2. Install Java 11
Update the package lists to ensure you have the latest versions:

'''
sudo apt update
Install the headless version of OpenJDK 11:

sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless
3. Clone the Project from Git
Navigate to the home directory (if not already there):

'''
Copy
Edit
cd ~
Clone the specified Git repository:

'''
git clone https://github.com/shashirajraja/Train-Ticket-Reservation-System.git

4. Build the Project with Maven

Install Maven:

sudo apt install maven
Navigate to the cloned project directory:

cd Calculator
Validate the Maven project configuration:

mvn validate
Run the project tests:

mvn test
Package the project (assuming it generates a WAR file):

mvn package
Note: The output WAR file will typically be in the target/ subdirectory.

5. Install and Configure Apache Tomcat
Download Apache Tomcat 9:

wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.102/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.102.tar.gz
Extract the downloaded tar.gz file:

tar -xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.102.tar.gz
Navigate to the Tomcat bin directory:

cd apache-tomcat-9.0.102/bin
Start the Tomcat server:

./startup.sh
To stop the Tomcat server:

./shutdown.sh
6. Configure Security Group for Tomcat Access
(Steps to navigate to the EC2 Security Group through the AWS console are assumed.)

Edit the Inbound Rules of the security group.

Add a rule:

Type: All TCP

Source: Anywhere IPv4 (0.0.0.0/0)

⚠️ Warning: Allowing traffic from anywhere on all TCP ports is a security risk. For production, restrict access to specific ports and IP ranges.

7. Deploy the WAR File
Copy the WAR file to the Tomcat webapps directory (adjust paths as needed):

cp ~/Calculator/target/TrainBook-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war ~/apache-tomcat-9.0.102/webapps/
Note: Adjust file names and paths if different in your project.

8. (Optional) Configure Tomcat Manager and Host Manager
Navigate to the manager web application:

cd ~/apache-tomcat-9.0.102/webapps/manager/
Comment out the <Valve> element in META-INF/context.xml if needed for access.

Navigate to the host-manager web application:

cd ~/apache-tomcat-9.0.102/webapps/host-manager/
Similarly, edit META-INF/context.xml and comment out the <Valve> tag.

9. (Optional) Configure Tomcat Users
Navigate to the Tomcat conf directory:

cd ~/apache-tomcat-9.0.102/conf/
Edit tomcat-users.xml to add admin access:

<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <user username="admin" password="your_password" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>
</tomcat-users>
10. Verify Deployment
Restart the Tomcat server:

~/apache-tomcat-9.0.102/bin/shutdown.sh
~/apache-tomcat-9.0.102/bin/startup.sh
Open your web browser and access your application:

http://ec2-98-81-227-245.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/TrainBook-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/
Assuming Tomcat is running on the default port 8080, and the WAR file is named TrainBook-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war.

📌 Note: This guide assumes a basic setup. For production environments, consider security hardening, firewall rules, HTTPS setup, and scalability measures.
